# Forking

## Auto-Adaptation

- `github.repository_owner` resolves dynamically
- `__SELF__` marker resolves to `<owner>/<owner>`
- Repo names get owner prefix at runtime

## What You Need to Do

1. Fork
2. Create PAT
3. Edit `secrets-config.yml` with your repos
4. Set secrets
5. Push

Everything else adapts automatically.
